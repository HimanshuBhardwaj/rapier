          to be specified by picking from the list of paths supported by a particular proxy. If the user does this, the UI will use this

  Subscription:
    description: >
      Subscriptions record the usage of an Subscription by a subscriber. 
      <p>Historical Note: The App concept in Apigee Edge (circa 2016) is similar to the Subscription concept,
      to the point where it can be considered a renaming. App was not the best choice of name because the concept 
      being modelled is not an app, it is just a key-protected usage of an APIProduct. Using
      one of these subscriptions per app is only a suggestionâ€”it is not possible to know whether customers use 
      a single subscription for a single app, a single subscription for many apps, or a many subscriptions for one app.

          The Key/Secret and the products they apply to. Unlike The 2016 Edge "App" concept, only one key per Subscription
          is supported. Edge was motiviated to allow many because they thought they were modeling apps, and apps
          may use multiple keys. Since subscriptions are not apps, and apps are free to use as many subscriptions as
          they like, there is no need to support multiples keys per Subscription
