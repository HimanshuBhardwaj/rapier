  <li> A set of Apigee Message Processors that handle the same set of customer domain names. (This is similar to the existing Apigee "pod" concept)</li>
  <li> A set of customer proxies deployed to the same Apigee "environment" </li>
  <li> A set of Apigee routers deployed to the same AWS region/AZ </li>
  <li> A Kubernetes cluster or namespace dedicated to a domain name belonging to an Apigee customer or Apigee itself. </li>
</ul> The state of an Environment is controlled by POSTing requests to the URL provided in its requests property The Deployment Service stores Environments that are currently (intended to be) running, but also stores Environments that once ran, and Environments that will run in the future.
