# Some people like to group all URI-valued properties under an array-valued 'links' property, and put
# the relationship name as the value of a 'rel' property, rather than putting it in a JSON property name.
# I do not understand the appeal of this pattern, but I wanted to show how you can do it with Rapier 
# if you want to.
